## Research 

Currently, in my PhD, I am developing a joint model for longitudinal and survival data with changepoints to model disease progression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). 
As a researcher, I have a strong interest in applying statistical methods to health-related research. 

If you have any question, suggestion or invite, please, reach out to me via e-mail or Linkedin.
